Huge nerd with a history as an Analyst in Renewable Energy, aspiring to become a Software Engineer. 

I love building tools and applications from the ground up. Most of my previous experience in building tools have been on my analysis teams, so I've utilized things such as Excel sheets, .ini config files, Microsoft Forms, and Outlook emails through Power Automate as user interfaces for the tools. Now, I'm going through and working my way through the Foundations curriculum of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to learn the essentials of Front End Engineering, so I can build web-facing interfaces for my future tools.
